            <h2>Return to earth</h2>
            <p>
                At 00:56 EDT the vehicle made a burn that removed it from the moons orbit and it went on a return trajectory towards earth.
                when the command module re entered the earths atmosphere at 12:35 EDT after 3 days of travel it became engulfed by plasma 
                due to its speed and the atmosphere's thickness, it briefly lost radio contact when this happened. At 12:51 EDT the commang 
                module lands in the pacific ocean and are picked up by a recovery team. They were sprayed with a disenfectant as a 
                precaution agains pathogens that might have been on the moon.

                The astronauts were collected by a helicopter it dropped them off on the U.S.S Hornet and they were put into a mobile quarantine trailer where
                they remained until they were at the lunar recieving laborotory in Houston Texas. President Nixon welcomed the astronauts and says to them over 
                an intercom "This is the greatest week in the history of the world since the Creation…. As a result of what you have done, the world’s never been closer together 
                . We can reach for the stars just as you have reached so far for the stars."

            <h2>The landing</h2>
            <p>When the eagle was descending towards the moon, Neil Armstrong was
                having difficulty finding a place to land, but luckily he found a 
                smooth place to land with just 25 seconds of fuel to spare. They 
                landed on July 20 1969 at 4:18 p.m. EDT.At around 10:40-10:56 p.m. 
                EDT Neil Armstrong got out of the lunar module hatch and started 
                going down the nine step ladder. When he was at the second step he pulled a 
                ring that deployed a tv camera. This camera broadcasted him going down to 
                the moons surface live to people on earth.At 10:56 p.m. Neil Armstrong takes 
                his first step on the moon and says his 
                famous quote "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.".
                This moment was the first time in history a man had set foot on a celestial
                body that was not earth.
