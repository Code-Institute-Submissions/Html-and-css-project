            <h2>The landing</h2>
            <p>When the eagle was descending towards the moon, Neil Armstrong was
                having difficulty finding a place to land, but luckily he found a 
                smooth place to land with just 25 seconds of fuel to spare. They 
                landed on July 20 1969 at 4:18 p.m. EDT.At around 10:40-10:56 p.m. 
                EDT Neil Armstrong got out of the lunar module hatch and started 
                going down the nine step ladder. When he was at the second step he pulled a 
                ring that deployed a tv camera. This camera broadcasted him going down to 
                the moons surface live to people on earth.At 10:56 p.m. Neil Armstrong takes 
                his first step on the moon and says his 
                famous quote "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.".
                This moment was the first time in history a man had set foot on a celestial
                body that was not earth.
